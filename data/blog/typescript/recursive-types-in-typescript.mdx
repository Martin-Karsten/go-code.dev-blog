## Why would you need recursive types?

Recursive types are primarily used to model data structures with a self-referential,
hierarchical, or recursive nature. Without recursive types,
it would be challenging to model these kinds of data structures in a type-safe way.
Further, Recursive types allow you to accurately describe the data structure in your program,
which can help prevent bugs and make your code easier to understand.

### Recursive Types in Trees

In a tree structure, each node can have children, and each child is a node itself.
As such, trees are inherently recursive. They are very common and used in many algorithms and data structures,
such as:

- binary trees
- syntax trees
- the Document Object Model (DOM) in web development

This is how you can possibly define a TreeNode interface (or type) in Typescript.
Notice how the properties left and right are referencing the TreeNode interface itself

```typescript
interface TreeNode {
  value: number
  left?: TreeNode
  right?: TreeNode
}
```

And it can be used like this

```typescript
let tree: TreeNode = {
  value: 1,
  left: {
    value: 2,
    left: {
      value: 4,
    },
    right: {
      value: 5,
    },
  },
  right: {
    value: 3,
  },
}
```

### Traversing a Tree recursively

Another approach would be to add all of the children to the TreeNode interface

```typescript
interface TreeNode {
  value: number
  children: TreeNode[]
}

let tree: TreeNode = {
  value: 1,
  children: [
    {
      value: 2,
      children: [],
    },
    {
      value: 3,
      children: [
        {
          value: 4,
          children: [],
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
}
```

In this case `children: TreeNode[]` will contain all it's children TreeNodes

**Now we can create a traverse function, go trough all the nodes recursively and type them corrctly at the same time.**

```typescript
function traverse(node: TreeNode) {
  console.log(node.value)
  node.children.forEach((child) => traverse(child))
}

traverse(tree) // Logs: 1, 2, 3, 4
```

### Summary

Recursive Types in Typescript always reference themselves and come in handy when dealing with recursion.
