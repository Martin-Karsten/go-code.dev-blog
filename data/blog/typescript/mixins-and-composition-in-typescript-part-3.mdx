Let's look out how to use [higher order functions](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/higher-order-functions-composing-software-5365cf2cbe99#:~:text=A%20higher%20order%20function%20is,return%20a%20function%20as%20output) to achieve reusablity. In [Part 1](https://www.go-code.dev/blog/typescript/mixins-and-composition-in-typescript-part-1)
we learned how to use Mixins to achieve code reusablity. In [Part 2](https://www.go-code.dev/blog/typescript/mixins-and-composition-in-typescript-part-2)
we used composition to achieve reusablity. In Part 3 we will use higher order functions to achieve reusablity.

## Higher order Functions

We define two interfaces

```typescript
interface CanFly {
  fly(): void
}

interface CanSwim {
  swim(): void
}
```

Next we implement two higher order functions. In the previous parts we used interfaces instead

```typescript
function fly() {
  console.log('I can fly!')
}

function swim() {
  console.log('I can swim!')
}
```

Now, we create a higher-order function that takes an object and a set of methods to be added to that object:

```typescript
function withMethods<T extends object, M extends object>(base: T, methods: M): T & M {
  return Object.assign(base, methods)
}
```

Laslty we create a Duck class that will call `fly` and `swim`

```typescript
class Duck {}

const duck = withMethods(new Duck(), { fly, swim })

duck.fly() // Output: I can fly!
duck.swim() // Output: I can swim!
```

## Conclusion

Reusability is achievable with different approaches. Mixins, Composition or higher order functions are just a few
possibilities.
