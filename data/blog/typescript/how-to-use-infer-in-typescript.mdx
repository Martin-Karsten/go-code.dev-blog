## What is the infer keyword

**In TypeScript, the infer keyword is used within the scope of a conditional type to infer a type based on the input type.** It allows you to define a type variable that represents the type you want to infer.
Typically infer is used with the `extends` clause in a condition type.
In other words: We check that the return type of a Function is of the type we defined.

Here is an example

```typescript
type ReturnTypeOfFunction<T> = T extends (...args: any) => infer R ? R : never
```

How does this code work?

1. `T extends (...args: any[]) => infer R`: This part checks whether the type `T` extends a function type with any number of arguments of any type `(...args: any[])`.
   If so, it will infer the return type of the function and assign it to the type variable `R`.
2. `? R : never`: This is a ternary conditional type operator. If the condition `T extends (...args: any[]) => infer R` is true (i.e., T is a function type),
   the ReturnTypeOfFunction type will be equal to the inferred return type R. If the condition is false (i.e., T is not a function type), the ReturnTypeOfFunction type will be equal to the `never` type.

```typescript
type ReturnTypeOfFunction<T> = T extends (...args: any) => infer R ? R : never

const func = (s: string) => s.length
const rt: ReturnTypeOfFunction<typeof func> = 1000
```

In the example above, func is function that takes a string as a argument. That satisifies the `T extends (...args: any[])` condition. Meaning it should be a function that can take any arguments.
`infer R ?` is true, meaning a function that takes any arguments, so we return the return type of the function. Which is a number (s.length)

Let's look another example

```typescript
type DiffReturnTypeOfFunction<T> = T extends (args: string) => infer R ? true : false

const func = (s: string) => s.length
const func2 = (n: number) => n.toString()

const rt: DiffReturnTypeOfFunction<typeof func> = true

const FalsyReturnType: DiffReturnTypeOfFunction<typeof func2> = false
```

1. In the example above `T extends (args: string)` states that our function takes an argument that must of type string.
   `const func = (s: string) => s.length` is a function that takes a string as an argument.
2. That's why it is possible for use to assign `const rt: DiffReturnTypeOfFunction<typeof func> = true` to true.
3. The second function `const func2 = (n: number) => n.toString()` takes a number as an argument. That's why we can only assign false
   `const FalsyReturnType: DiffReturnTypeOfFunction<typeof func2> = false`

## Summary:

Using infer is not that difficult, once you understand what is actually used for.
We always use it with a ternary operator and infer the type based on the input type
