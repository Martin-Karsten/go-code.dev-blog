## What is a Mixin?

A mixin is a design pattern that allows you to add methods or properties from one `class` or `object` to another,
enabling code reusablity.
Mixins can be thought of as a way to achieve [multiple inheritance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_inheritance#:~:text=Multiple%20inheritance%20is%20a%20feature,one%20particular%20object%20or%20class.)
in languages, that don't natively support it.
Instead of inheriting methods and properties through a class hierarchy,
mixins allow you to "mix in" or compose the desired behaviors into a class or object.

Let's look at an example

## Using Mixins

First we implement two different classes with different behaviours

```typescript
// Define two interfaces representing two different behaviors
interface CanFly {
  fly(): void
}

interface CanSwim {
  swim(): void
}

// Implement the behaviors in separate classes
class Flying implements CanFly {
  fly() {
    console.log('I can fly!')
  }
}

class Swimming implements CanSwim {
  swim() {
    console.log('I can swim!')
  }
}
```

Now we implement a mixin creator

```typescript
function applyMixins(derivedConstructur: any, baseConstructors: any[]) {
  baseConstructors.forEach((baseCtor) => {
    Object.getOwnPropertyNames(baseCtor.prototype).forEach((name) => {
      if (name !== 'constructor') {
        derivedCtor.prototype[name] = baseCtor.prototype[name]
      }
    })
  })
}
```

Lastly we create a Duck class and apply the mixins

```typescript
class Duck {}

applyMixins(Duck, [Flying, Swimming])

const duck = new Duck()
;(duck as Duck & CanFly & CanSwim).fly() // Output: I can fly!
;(duck as Duck & CanFly & CanSwim).swim() // Output: I can swim!
```

## Conclusion

Using mixins allows us to use functionality from multiple classes in a single class. In [Part 2](https://www.go-code.dev/blog/typescript/mixins-and-composition-in-typescript-part-2) we will
look at another way to achieve the same result using Composition with Interfaces.
