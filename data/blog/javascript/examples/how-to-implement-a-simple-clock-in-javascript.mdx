Hour hand: The number of hours since the start of the day is multiplied by 30,
which gives the number of degrees that the hour hand should rotate.
This is because there are 12 hours on a clock face,
and 360 degrees divided by 12 hours equals 30 degrees per hour.
However, this calculation assumes that the hour hand moves smoothly between the hour marks on the clock face,
which is not the case in reality. To get a more accurate representation of the hour hand position,
you would need to take into account the number of minutes past the hour as well,
since the hour hand moves slightly between each hour mark.

Minute hand: The number of minutes since the start of the hour is multiplied by 6,
which gives the number of degrees that the minute hand should rotate.
This is because there are 60 minutes in an hour,
and 360 degrees divided by 60 minutes equals 6 degrees per minute.

Second hand: The number of seconds since the start of the minute is multiplied by 6,
which gives the number of degrees that the second hand should rotate.
This is because there are 60 seconds in a minute,
and 360 degrees divided by 60 seconds equals 6 degrees per second.

```javascript
function setTime() {
  const now = new Date()
  const hour = now.getHours()
  const minute = now.getMinutes()
  const second = now.getSeconds()

  const hourEl = document.querySelector('.hour')
  const minuteEl = document.querySelector('.minute')
  const secondEl = document.querySelector('.second')

  hourEl.style.transform = `rotate(${hour * 30}deg)`
  minuteEl.style.transform = `rotate(${minute * 6}deg)`
  secondEl.style.transform = `rotate(${second * 6}deg)`
}

setInterval(setTime, 1000)
```

## using requestAnimationFrame

The first part of the formula, ((hours % 12) / 12) \* 360, calculates the angle for the hour value.
It uses the modulo operator % to ensure that the hour value is between
0 and 11 (since the clock is a 12-hour clock), and then divides it by 12 to get a fraction
between 0 and 1, which is then multiplied by 360 to convert it to degrees.

The second part of the formula, (minutes / 60) \* 30,
calculates the additional angle for the minute value.
Since the hour hand moves gradually between the hour values,
the minute value needs to be added to the hour angle to get the correct position for the hour hand.
This part of the formula calculates the additional angle based on the current minute value.
It converts the minute value to a fraction between 0 and 1 by dividing it by 60,
then multiplies it by 30 to get the corresponding angle in degrees.

The minuteAngle and secondAngle variables are calculated in a similar way,
based on the current minute and second values.
The minuteAngle is simply calculated as (minutes / 60) _ 360,
since the minute hand moves continuously around the clock face.
The secondAngle is calculated as (seconds / 60) _ 360,
since the second hand also moves continuously around the clock face.

```javascript
function updateTime() {
  const now = new Date()

  const hours = now.getHours()
  const minutes = now.getMinutes()
  const seconds = now.getSeconds()

  const hourHand = document.querySelector('.hour')
  const minuteHand = document.querySelector('.minute')
  const secondHand = document.querySelector('.second')

  const hourAngle = ((hours % 12) / 12) * 360 + (minutes / 60) * 30
  const minuteAngle = (minutes / 60) * 360
  const secondAngle = (seconds / 60) * 360

  function animateClock() {
    hourHand.style.transform = `rotate(${hourAngle}deg)`
    minuteHand.style.transform = `rotate(${minuteAngle}deg)`
    secondHand.style.transform = `rotate(${secondAngle}deg)`

    window.requestAnimationFrame(animateClock)
  }

  window.requestAnimationFrame(animateClock)
}

setInterval(updateTime, 1000)
```
